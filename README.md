## Description

This midterm will assess both your ability to structure content with semantic `HTML` tags, format text, include images and links, and apply `CSS` to a page that brings your amazing Product Card design to life. 

Students will also be assessed on their ability to commit their code to GitHub and activate the GitHub pages service.

Create and host a web page that meets the following requirements:

- Build and style one (1) web page with a file name `index.html`
- Web page must render well in desktop mode
- `CSS` must be stored in a seperate file and not be embedded in your `HTML`
- Web page must meet the content and design requirements identified within this document
- Web page must have valid and compliant HTML and CSS as assessed by the `W3C Validator`
- You must use the GitHub Repository generated by GitHub Classrooms for the midterm exam
- Web page must be hosted using GitHub Pages service
- Web page must be reachable by a browser on the public internet
- You do not need to worry about mobile mode when applying `CSS` to your page

## Content and design requirements

You are building a Product Card for a Cappuccino that could be used on the Binary Beans Cafe website. 

The Product Card has a category, title, description, price and link for making a purchase. (The button should be marked up as a link `<a>`)

The image of a cup of coffee has been provided for you in the `images` folder. 

The content for the card has been provided for you in the `index.html` file.

**You are absolutely allowed to modify the colours, image, sizing, spacing, and design elements (like background colour, border radius) to acheive your custom design. Your product card should look like this, but it deosn't have to be exactly like this.** 

**You are also asked to add your own unique design element such as a link hover state, background gradient, shadow effect, or other unique design element.**

| HTML              | **35%**          | The HTML code submitted is well formed, and structured. Appropriate semantic elements are used throughout the document. Correct use of headings `<h1-h6>` and heading structure. The web page has the appropriate meta tags in the `<head>` to set the charset and viewport values.|
|CSS     | **35%**          | The  CSS code submitted is well formed, and implements the Product Card as specified in the content and design requirements. The design only has to work in desktop mode as we have yet to cover responsive design.                                                          |

For example, a background gradient, box shadow, hover state for link, border radius (or lack thereof), changes to spacing, or any unique design elements.                                                                                                                                             |
| W3C Compliance          | **10%**          | There are no validation errors found in the code for either the HTML or CSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GitHub&nbsp;submission  | **10%**          | The HTML content is added to the `index.html` file and CSS is added to the `style.css` file. The repository has both the assignment README.md file and a LICENSE file that contains the MIT license. GitHub Pages services has been correctly activated.                                                                              |

## Late submissions

- There is no make up or deferred midterm exam
- Students that fail to submit a midterm will receive a mark of 0 and will have their final exam weight be adjusted to include the midterm
- For example, the midterm is worth 10% of your mark, and the final is worth 20%. If you do not attend the midterm your final exam weight will be adjusted to 30% (10% + 20%) of your final grade.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<dl>
  
  <dt>What type of content should I include in the Product Card that I am building?</dt>
  <dd>The content has already been provided for you. You are permitted to add or slightly modify the content if your design warrants it.</dd>

  <dd>No! You only need to make your web page work in desktop mode. Don't worry about mobile mode for this Assignment.</dd>

  <dt>Can I use my code from Assignment 01 or Tutorials</dt>
  <dd>Yes. Absolutely. You are permitted to use any code from any source. External sources (work that you didn't do) must be cited.</dd>
 
  <dt>Can I use trademarked or copywritten material on my page?</dt>
  <dd>Yes! As this is for educational purposes, all of the source is open, and no one is trying to sell their design or code you can absolutely use trademarked or copywritten material. Just add a comment in your code where you got the material.</dd>
